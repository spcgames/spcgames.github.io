## Project Description
The second project for DGIM 2530 - Game Design 1 creates a simple Trivia Game using Tumult Hype. The project consists of three scenes and utilizes an external Javascript file, which is used to customize the content displayed. Global variables are used to keep track of the score between scenes and are defined in Tumult Hype using the "Edit Head HTML" option.

----
## Customization
The game displayed here is the final result created as an inclass demonstration led by the instructor. Students were then given two weeks to modify the trivia content (Questions, Responses and Factoids) as well as the color scheme, layout, typography and other elements. 

----
## Hosting and Usability Testing
A GitHub account was created and the game was hosted at <https://spcgames.github.io/trivia/>. Students were then required to find two volunteers and have each perform a usability test. Students submitted the basic Tumult Hype file and the usability test results, along with a lin to the actual game for grading.
